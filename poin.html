        <h1>C Pointer Question 1</h1>
        <p>Question: What is a pointer in C programming?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: Pointers are used for various purposes, including dynamic memory allocation, accessing hardware, and building data structures.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Repeat the following structure for each of the C pointer questions -->

    <div class="question">
        <h1>C Pointer Question 2</h1>
        <p>Question: How do you declare a pointer variable in C?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> You declare a pointer variable by specifying the data type followed by an asterisk (*), e.g., int *ptr;</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: The asterisk indicates that the variable is a pointer.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>C Pointer Question 3</h1>
        <p>Question: How do you initialize a pointer in C?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> You can initialize a pointer by assigning it the address of a variable, e.g., int *ptr = &myVariable;</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: This makes the pointer point to the memory location of the variable.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>C Pointer Question 4</h1>
        <p>Question: What is the "dereference" operator in C?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> The dereference operator (*) is used to access the value stored at the memory address pointed to by a pointer, e.g., int x = *ptr;</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: It allows you to manipulate the data pointed to by the pointer.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>C Pointer Question 5</h1>
        <p>Question: How do you find the memory address of a variable in C?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> You can use the address-of operator (&) followed by the variable name, e.g., &myVariable;</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: This operator returns the memory address where the variable is stored.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>C Pointer Question 6</h1>
        <p>Question: What is a NULL pointer in C?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> A NULL pointer is a pointer that does not point to any memory address. It is typically used to indicate that a pointer is not initialized.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: Dereferencing a NULL pointer can lead to undefined behavior.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>C Pointer Question 7</h1>
        <p>Question: How do you allocate memory dynamically using pointers in C?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> You can use functions like `malloc`, `calloc`, or `realloc` to allocate memory dynamically, e.g., int *arr = (int*)malloc(10 * sizeof(int));</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: Dynamic memory allocation allows you to create data structures of variable size at runtime.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>C Pointer Question 8</h1>
        <p>Question: What is a pointer to a function in C?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> A pointer to a function is a variable that can store the address of a function. It allows you to call functions indirectly through the pointer.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: Function pointers are useful for implementing callbacks and dynamic function invocation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>C Pointer Question 9</h1>
        <p>Question: How do you free dynamically allocated memory in C?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> You can use the `free` function to release dynamically allocated memory, e.g., free(arr);</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: Failing to free memory can lead to memory leaks.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>C Pointer Question 10</h1>
        <p>Question: What is the difference between pass by reference and pass by value in C?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> Pass by reference allows a function to modify the original value of a variable using a pointer, while pass by value only allows the function to work with a copy of the variable.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: Pass by reference is achieved by passing a pointer to the variable, while pass by value passes the actual value of the variable.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>C Pointer Question 11</h1>
        <p>Question: What is the purpose of the `sizeof` operator in C?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> The `sizeof` operator is used to determine the size (in bytes) of a data type or an object in memory, e.g., sizeof(int);</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: It is useful for memory allocation and pointer arithmetic.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>C Pointer Question 12</h1>
        <p>Question: How do you use pointers to create and manipulate arrays in C?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> You can use pointers to create dynamic arrays and access array elements using pointer arithmetic, e.g., int *arr = (int*)malloc(5 * sizeof(int));</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: Pointers and arrays are closely related in C, and you can use pointers to iterate through arrays.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>C Pointer Question 13</h1>
        <p>Question: What is a double pointer in C?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> A double pointer (e.g., `int **ptr`) is a pointer that points to another pointer. It is often used for dynamic two-dimensional arrays and modifying pointers within functions.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: Double pointers are used to indirectly access memory locations.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>C Pointer Question 14</h1>
        <p>Question: How do you pass a pointer to a function in C?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> You can pass a pointer to a function as an argument, allowing the function to operate on the data pointed to by the pointer, e.g., `void myFunction(int *ptr)`.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: This allows functions to modify the original data.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>C Pointer Question 15</h1>
        <p>Question: What is pointer arithmetic in C?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> Pointer arithmetic involves adding or subtracting integers to/from pointers. It allows you to navigate through memory locations, especially when working with arrays.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: Be careful with pointer arithmetic to avoid accessing memory outside of the allocated space.</p>
