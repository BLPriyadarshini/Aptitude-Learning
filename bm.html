    <div class="question">
        <h1>C Bit Manipulation Question 6</h1>
        <p>Question: How do you check if a specific bit is set in an integer in C?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> You can check if a specific bit is set by using the AND operator (&) with a bitmask that has only the target bit set to 1, e.g., `if (num & (1 << position)) { /* Bit is set */ }`</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: This code checks if the bit at the specified position is set (1).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>C Bit Manipulation Question 7</h1>
        <p>Question: How do you check if a specific bit is clear (unset) in an integer in C?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> You can check if a specific bit is clear by using the AND operator (&) with a bitmask that has only the target bit set to 0, e.g., `if (!(num & (1 << position))) { /* Bit is clear */ }`</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: This code checks if the bit at the specified position is clear (0).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>C Bit Manipulation Question 8</h1>
        <p>Question: How do you set multiple bits at once in an integer in C?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> You can set multiple bits by using the OR operator (|) with a bitmask that represents the bits to be set, e.g., `num = num | bitmask;`</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: The bitmask should have 1s at the positions where you want to set bits.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>C Bit Manipulation Question 9</h1>
        <p>Question: How do you clear multiple bits at once in an integer in C?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> You can clear multiple bits by using the AND operator (&) with a bitmask that represents the bits to be cleared, e.g., `num = num & ~bitmask;`</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: The bitmask should have 0s at the positions where you want to clear bits.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>C Bit Manipulation Question 10</h1>
        <p>Question: How do you check if all bits are set in an integer in C?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> You can check if all bits are set by comparing the integer to a bitmask with all bits set, e.g., `if (num == INT_MAX) { /* All bits are set */ }`</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: `INT_MAX` is a constant representing the maximum value of an `int`.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>C Bit Manipulation Question 11</h1>
        <p>Question: How do you check if all bits are clear in an integer in C?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> You can check if all bits are clear by comparing the integer to 0, e.g., `if (num == 0) { /* All bits are clear */ }`</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: If the integer is 0, it means all bits are clear.</p>

        <p>Question: How do you count the number of set bits (1s) in an integer in C?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> You can count set bits using bitwise AND and a loop, e.g.,</p>
        <pre><code>int count = 0;
while (num > 0) {
    count += num & 1;
    num >>= 1;
}</code></pre>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: This code counts the number of set bits in the integer.</p>

        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> You can count leading zeros using a loop and bitwise right shift, e.g.,</p>
        <pre><code>int count = 0;
while (!(num & (1 << (sizeof(int) * 8 - 1)))) {
    count++;
    num <<= 1;
}</code></pre>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: This code counts the number of leading zeros in the integer.</p>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>C Bit Manipulation Question 14</h1>
        <p>Question: How do you reverse the bits in an integer in C?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> You can reverse the bits using a loop and bitwise operators, e.g.,</p>
        <pre><code>unsigned int reverseBits(unsigned int num) {
    unsigned int numOfBits = sizeof(num) * 8;
    unsigned int reverseNum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < numOfBits; i++) {
        if (num & (1 << i)) {
            reverseNum |= 1 << ((numOfBits - 1) - i);
        }

        <p>Question: How do you check if a number is a power of 2 in C using bit manipulation?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> You can check if a number is a power of 2 by counting set bits and checking if there is only one set bit, e.g.,</p>
        <pre><code>bool isPowerOfTwo(int num) {
    return num > 0 && (num & (num - 1)) == 0;
}</code></pre>
