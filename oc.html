        <h1>OOP Concepts Question 1</h1>
        <p>Question: What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects, which are instances of classes, to model and organize data and behavior in software systems.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: OOP promotes the use of classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism to structure and design code.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Repeat the following structure for each of the OOP concepts questions -->

    <div class="question">
        <h1>OOP Concepts Question 2</h1>
        <p>Question: What is a class in OOP?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> A class in OOP is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior that objects created from the class will have.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: Classes include attributes (data members) and methods (functions) that operate on the attributes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>OOP Concepts Question 3</h1>
        <p>Question: What is an object in OOP?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> An object in OOP is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity or concept and can be manipulated using the methods defined in the class.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: Objects encapsulate data and behavior.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>OOP Concepts Question 4</h1>
        <p>Question: What is inheritance in OOP?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> Inheritance in OOP is a mechanism that allows a new class (derived or subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class (base or superclass).</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: Inheritance promotes code reuse and establishes an "is-a" relationship between classes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>OOP Concepts Question 5</h1>
        <p>Question: What is encapsulation in OOP?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> Encapsulation in OOP is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data within a single unit (a class). It restricts direct access to some of an object's components.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: Encapsulation helps in data hiding and access control.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>OOP Concepts Question 6</h1>
        <p>Question: What is polymorphism in OOP?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> Polymorphism in OOP is the ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same method or function call in a way that is specific to their individual class implementations.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: Polymorphism enables dynamic method dispatch and flexibility in object-oriented programming.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>OOP Concepts Question 7</h1>
        <p>Question: What is a constructor in OOP?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> A constructor in OOP is a special method within a class that is automatically called when an object is created. It is used to initialize the object's attributes and set its initial state.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: Constructors have the same name as the class and may have parameters.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>OOP Concepts Question 8</h1>
        <p>Question: What is a destructor in OOP?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> A destructor in OOP is a special method within a class that is automatically called when an object is destroyed. It is used to clean up resources and perform finalization tasks.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: Destructors have the same name as the class preceded by a tilde (~).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>OOP Concepts Question 9</h1>
        <p>Question: What is method overloading in OOP?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> Method overloading in OOP is a feature that allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists. The correct method is selected based on the number or type of arguments passed.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: Method overloading enhances code readability and provides flexibility.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>OOP Concepts Question 10</h1>
        <p>Question: What is method overriding in OOP?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> Method overriding in OOP is a feature that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. The overridden method in the subclass should have the same name, return type, and parameters.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: Method overriding enables runtime polymorphism.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>OOP Concepts Question 11</h1>
        <p>Question: What is an abstract class in OOP?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> An abstract class in OOP is a class that cannot be instantiated. It is designed to serve as a base class for other classes and may contain abstract methods that must be implemented by its subclasses.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: Abstract classes provide a common interface for related classes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>OOP Concepts Question 12</h1>
        <p>Question: What is a static method in OOP?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> A static method in OOP is a method that belongs to the class rather than an instance of the class (an object). It can be called using the class name and does not have access to instance-specific data.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: Static methods are commonly used for utility functions and do not require an object to be created.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>OOP Concepts Question 13</h1>
        <p>Question: What is composition in OOP?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> Composition in OOP is a design principle that involves creating complex objects by combining simpler objects as their parts. It is used to build more complex structures while maintaining flexibility and reusability.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: Composition promotes a "has-a" relationship between classes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>OOP Concepts Question 14</h1>
        <p>Question: What is an interface in OOP?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> An interface in OOP is a contract that defines a set of methods that a class must implement. It provides a way to achieve multiple inheritance and define a common behavior for unrelated classes.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: Classes that implement an interface must provide concrete implementations for its methods.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>OOP Concepts Question 15</h1>
        <p>Question: What is a design pattern in OOP?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> A design pattern in OOP is a reusable and proven solution to a common software design problem. It provides a template for solving design challenges and improving code maintainability and scalability.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: Design patterns help in designing robust and efficient software systems.</p>
