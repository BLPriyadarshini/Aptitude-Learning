        <h1>Constructors and Destructors Question 1</h1>
        <p>Question: What is a constructor in object-oriented programming?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> A constructor in object-oriented programming is a special method that is automatically called when an object of a class is created. It is used to initialize the object's attributes and set its initial state.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: Constructors have the same name as the class and may have parameters.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Repeat the following structure for each of the constructors and destructors questions -->

    <div class="question">
        <h1>Constructors and Destructors Question 2</h1>
        <p>Question: What is the purpose of a constructor?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> The purpose of a constructor is to initialize the object's attributes and set its initial state when the object is created.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: Constructors ensure that an object starts with a well-defined state.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>Constructors and Destructors Question 3</h1>
        <p>Question: What is a default constructor?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> A default constructor is a constructor with no parameters. It is automatically provided by the compiler if no constructors are defined in a class.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: Default constructors initialize the object with default values.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>Constructors and Destructors Question 4</h1>
        <p>Question: Can a class have multiple constructors?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> Yes, a class can have multiple constructors. This is known as constructor overloading, where different constructors have different parameter lists.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: Constructor overloading allows for creating objects with various initialization options.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>Constructors and Destructors Question 5</h1>
        <p>Question: What is a destructor in object-oriented programming?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> A destructor in object-oriented programming is a special method that is automatically called when an object is destroyed. It is used to clean up resources and perform finalization tasks.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: Destructors have the same name as the class preceded by a tilde (~).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>Constructors and Destructors Question 6</h1>
        <p>Question: When is a destructor called?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> A destructor is called automatically when an object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It ensures that resources are released and any cleanup is performed.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: Destructors are important for resource management.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>Constructors and Destructors Question 7</h1>
        <p>Question: Do destructors have parameters?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> No, destructors do not have parameters. They are defined without any parameters.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: Destructors are called automatically and do not accept arguments.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>Constructors and Destructors Question 8</h1>
        <p>Question: What happens if a class does not have a destructor?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> If a class does not have a destructor, the compiler generates a default destructor that does nothing. This may be suitable for classes that do not require cleanup.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: In some cases, an explicit destructor is unnecessary.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>Constructors and Destructors Question 9</h1>
        <p>Question: Can you define both a constructor and a destructor in a class?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> Yes, you can define both a constructor and a destructor in a class. The constructor initializes the object, while the destructor cleans up resources when the object is destroyed.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: Constructors and destructors work together to manage object lifecycle.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>Constructors and Destructors Question 10</h1>
        <p>Question: What is the purpose of a copy constructor?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> The purpose of a copy constructor is to create a new object by copying the values of another object of the same class. It is used for object initialization by copying.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: Copy constructors are used when objects are passed by value or when objects are returned from functions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>Constructors and Destructors Question 11</h1>
        <p>Question: How is a copy constructor different from a regular constructor?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> A copy constructor is specifically used to create a new object by copying the values of an existing object of the same class. A regular constructor is used to initialize an object from scratch.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: Copy constructors facilitate object copying.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>Constructors and Destructors Question 12</h1>
        <p>Question: What is the purpose of a parameterized constructor?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> The purpose of a parameterized constructor is to initialize an object with specific values provided as parameters during object creation. It allows for customized initialization.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: Parameterized constructors provide flexibility in object initialization.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>Constructors and Destructors Question 13</h1>
        <p>Question: Can a class have both a default constructor and a parameterized constructor?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> Yes, a class can have both a default constructor (with no parameters) and a parameterized constructor (with parameters). This allows for object initialization with or without customization.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: Providing both types of constructors enhances usability.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>Constructors and Destructors Question 14</h1>
        <p>Question: What is constructor chaining in OOP?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> Constructor chaining in OOP is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor in the same class. It allows for code reuse and can simplify constructor implementation.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: Constructor chaining is achieved using the `this()` keyword.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>Constructors and Destructors Question 15</h1>
        <p>Question: Can a class have multiple destructors?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> No, a class can have only one destructor. Destructors do not support overloading, and there can be only one destructor with the same name as the class.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: Destructors are unique and automatically called when an object is destroyed.</p>
