        <h1>C++ Class and Object Question 1</h1>
        <p>Question: What is a class in C++?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> A class in C++ is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior of objects.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: A class includes data members (attributes) and member functions (methods).</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Repeat the following structure for each of the C++ class and object questions -->

    <div class="question">
        <h1>C++ Class and Object Question 2</h1>
        <p>Question: What is an object in C++?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> An object in C++ is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity and can be used to access the properties and behaviors defined in the class.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: Objects allow you to work with the data and methods defined in a class.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>C++ Class and Object Question 3</h1>
        <p>Question: How do you define a class in C++?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> You can define a class in C++ using the `class` keyword, e.g.,</p>
        <pre><code>class MyClass {
    // Class members and methods here
};</code></pre>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: This code defines a class named `MyClass`.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>C++ Class and Object Question 4</h1>
        <p>Question: How do you create an object of a class in C++?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> You can create an object of a class by using the class name followed by the object name, e.g.,</p>
        <pre><code>MyClass myObject;</code></pre>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: This code creates an object of the `MyClass` class named `myObject`.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>C++ Class and Object Question 5</h1>
        <p>Question: How do you access the data members of an object in C++?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> You can access the data members of an object using the dot (`.`) operator, e.g., `myObject.memberVariable;`</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: This code accesses the value of `memberVariable` in the `myObject` object.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>C++ Class and Object Question 6</h1>
        <p>Question: How do you call a member function of an object in C++?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> You can call a member function of an object using the dot (`.`) operator, e.g., `myObject.memberFunction();`</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: This code calls the `memberFunction` of the `myObject` object.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>C++ Class and Object Question 7</h1>
        <p>Question: What is the constructor of a class in C++?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> A constructor is a special member function in a C++ class that is automatically called when an object is created. It initializes the object.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: Constructors have the same name as the class and can have parameters.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>C++ Class and Object Question 8</h1>
        <p>Question: What is the destructor of a class in C++?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> A destructor is a special member function in a C++ class that is automatically called when an object is destroyed. It cleans up resources used by the object.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: Destructors have the same name as the class preceded by a tilde (~).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>C++ Class and Object Question 9</h1>
        <p>Question: What is encapsulation in C++?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data within a single unit (a class). It hides the internal details of an object.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: Encapsulation helps in data abstraction and access control.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>C++ Class and Object Question 10</h1>
        <p>Question: What is inheritance in C++?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> Inheritance is a feature of C++ that allows a class (called a derived class or subclass) to inherit the properties and behaviors of another class (called a base class or superclass).</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: Inheritance promotes code reusability and establishes an "is-a" relationship between classes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>C++ Class and Object Question 11</h1>
        <p>Question: What is polymorphism in C++?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> Polymorphism is a feature of C++ that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It enables method overriding and dynamic binding.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: Polymorphism promotes flexibility and extensibility in object-oriented programming.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>C++ Class and Object Question 12</h1>
        <p>Question: What is a constructor initializer list in C++?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> A constructor initializer list is used in the constructor of a class to initialize the data members of the class when an object is created. It follows a colon (`:`) after the constructor's parameter list.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: Constructor initializer lists are used to initialize data members before the constructor's body is executed.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>C++ Class and Object Question 13</h1>
        <p>Question: What is method overriding in C++?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> Method overriding is a feature in C++ where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its base class. It allows the subclass to customize the behavior of inherited methods.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: Method overriding is essential for achieving runtime polymorphism.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>C++ Class and Object Question 14</h1>
        <p>Question: What is a friend function in C++?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> A friend function in C++ is a function that is not a member of a class but is allowed to access the private and protected members of that class. It is declared as a friend of the class using the `friend` keyword.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: Friend functions are often used for operator overloading and providing external functions that work closely with a class.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>C++ Class and Object Question 15</h1>
        <p>Question: What is operator overloading in C++?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> Operator overloading is a feature in C++ that allows you to define how an operator should work for objects of a class. It enables custom behavior for operators such as `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, etc.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: Operator overloading makes C++ classes more intuitive and user-friendly.</p>
