        <h1>Average Question 3</h1>
        <p>Question: The average age of a family of four is 32 years. What is the total age of the family?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> The total age is 128 years.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: The total age is calculated as (Average age) * (Number of family members). In this case, it's 32 * 4 = 128 years.</p>

        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> The sum is 72.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: The sum is calculated as (Average) * (Number of numbers). In this case, it's 18 * 4 = 72.</p>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>Average Question 6</h1>
        <p>Question: The average of six consecutive even numbers is 24. What is the smallest of these numbers?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> The smallest number is 20.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: Since the numbers are consecutive even numbers, the smallest can be calculated as (Average - Number of terms + 1). In this case, it's 24 - 6 + 1 = 19 + 1 = 20.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>Average Question 7</h1>
        <p>Question: The average of 8 numbers is 48. If two numbers are removed, the average becomes 52. What are the two numbers?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> The two numbers are 20 and 28.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: Let the sum of all 8 numbers be X. So, (X/8) = 48. Therefore, X = 48 * 8 = 384. Now, when two numbers are removed, the sum becomes (X - 20 - 28). The new average is (X - 20 - 28)/6 = 52. Solving for X gives X = 384, which confirms that the two numbers are 20 and 28.</p>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>Average Question 8</h1>
        <p>Question: The average of 10 numbers is 30. If each number is multiplied by 5, what is the new average?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> The new average is 150.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: When each number is multiplied by a constant, the new average also gets multiplied by that constant. In this case, it's 30 * 5 = 150.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>Average Question 9</h1>
        <p>Question: The average of 15 numbers is 18. If the average of the first 10 numbers is 16, what is the average of the last 5 numbers?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> The average of the last 5 numbers is 28.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: To find the average of the last 5 numbers, we can use the formula for weighted average: (Total Average) = [(Average of the first 10 numbers * Number of first numbers) + (Average of the last 5 numbers * Number of last numbers)] / Total Number of Numbers. Solving for the average of the last 5 numbers, we get (18 * 15 - 16 * 10) / 5 = 28.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>Average Question 10</h1>
        <p>Question: The average of 9 numbers is 25. If the average of the first 4 numbers is 20, what is the average of the last 5 numbers?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> The average of the last 5 numbers is 30.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: To find the average of the last 5 numbers, we can use the formula for weighted average: (Total Average) = [(Average of the first 4 numbers * Number of first numbers) + (Average of the last 5 numbers * Number of last numbers)] / Total Number of Numbers. Solving for the average of the last 5 numbers, we get (25 * 9 - 20 * 4) / 5 = 30.</p>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>Average Question 11</h1>
        <p>Question: The average age of a group of 6 friends is 28 years. If the age of a new friend is added to the group, the average becomes 30 years. What is the age of the new friend?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> The age of the new friend is 36 years.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: Let the sum of the ages of the 6 friends be X. So, (X/6) = 28. Therefore, X = 28 * 6 = 168. Now, when the new friend is added, the sum becomes (X + Age of the new friend). The new average is (X + Age of the new friend)/7 = 30. Solving for the age of the new friend, we get (168 + Age of the new friend)/7 = 30, which leads to the age of the new friend being 36 years.</p>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>Average Question 12</h1>
        <p>Question: The average of 15 numbers is 35. If the average of the first 9 numbers is 30, what is the average of the last 6 numbers?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> The average of the last 6 numbers is 45.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: To find the average of the last 6 numbers, we can use the formula for weighted average: (Total Average) = [(Average of the first 9 numbers * Number of first numbers) + (Average of the last 6 numbers * Number of last numbers)] / Total Number of Numbers. Solving for the average of the last 6 numbers, we get (35 * 15 - 30 * 9) / 6 = 45.</p>

    <div class="question">
        <h1>Average Question 13</h1>
        <p>Question: The average of 20 numbers is 40. If the average of the first 10 numbers is 35, what is the average of the last 10 numbers?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> The average of the last 10 numbers is 45.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: To find the average of the last 10 numbers, we can use the formula for weighted average: (Total Average) = [(Average of the first 10 numbers * Number of first numbers) + (Average of the last 10 numbers * Number of last numbers)] / Total Number of Numbers. Solving for the average of the last 10 numbers, we get (40 * 20 - 35 * 10) / 10 = 45.</p>

        <h1>Average Question 14</h1>
        <p>Question: The average of 12 numbers is 28. If the average of the first 6 numbers is 24, what is the average of the last 6 numbers?</p>
        <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> The average of the last 6 numbers is 32.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Explanation: To find the average of the last 6 numbers, we can use the formula for weighted average: (Total Average) = [(Average of the first 6 numbers * Number of first numbers) + (Average of the last 6 numbers * Number of last numbers)] / Total Number of Numbers. Solving for the average of the last 6 numbers, we get (28 * 12 - 24 * 6) / 6 = 32.</p>
